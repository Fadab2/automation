## Overview

Given a document potential-contacts, find and collect all email addresses and phone numbers.

## Getting Started

### Lab 19

This lab required us to create:

1. Phone numbers may be in various formats.
(xxx) yyy-zzzz, yyy-zzzz, xxx-yyy-zzzz, etc.
-phone numbers with missing area code should presume 206

-phone numbers should be stored in xxx-yyy-zzzz format.

2.Once emails and phone numbers are found they should be stored in two separate documents.

3.The information should be sorted in ascending order.
*note*Duplicate entries are not allowed.
